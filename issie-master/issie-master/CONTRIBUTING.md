# Contributing to Issie


* See the Issie `Info --> Bug Reports` for information about how to report a possible bug in an Issie issue
* We do not have CI testing (or indeed at the moment any automatic testing): if you make a PR say how much you have tested it, or why you think it won't break anything
* If you are writing new code take to heart the extensive [Issie coding guidelines](https://github.com/tomcl/issie/wiki/Coding-guidelines-for-ISSIE)
