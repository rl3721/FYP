## SmartWire
During the demo, it was found that there could be a potential bug, causing two wires from the same net to look like there is a small gap between the 2 wires. Upon further inspection, it was found that the length of 2 wire segments are equal but are just rendered differently possibly due to the wire radius problem as suggested by Dr Clarke. No fix was required.

## SmartSize
Changed SmartSize to only resize custom components.
